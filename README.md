# ShareProm
This repository contains the source code of ShareProm, a Secure Multi-party computation approach for Inter-organizational Process Mining. The system is still under development. A research publication is pending for the system by [Gamal Elkoumy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y1ze0vQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Peterson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Le-1B90AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), [Marlon Dumas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9lIttRkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) , [Peeter Laud](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3hc5DR8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Alisa Pankova](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KG2eH5sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Matthias Weldich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P_9a7I0AAAAJ&hl=en).

This repository contains scripts for the implementation of Shareprom and for performing the experimental evaluation of the system. The system is implemented on top of Sharemind[1], a secure multi-party computation. The implementation of the system is in SecreC, a C++-like language that runs on top of Sharemind.
