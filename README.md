# ShareProm
This repository contains the source code of ShareProm, a Secure Multi-party computation system for Inter-organizational Process Mining. The system is still under development. A research publication is pending for the system by [Gamal Elkoumy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y1ze0vQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Peterson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Le-1B90AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), [Marlon Dumas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9lIttRkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) , [Peeter Laud](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3hc5DR8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Alisa Pankova](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KG2eH5sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Matthias Weldich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P_9a7I0AAAAJ&hl=en).

This repository contains scripts for the implementation of Shareprom and for performing the experimental evaluation of the system. The system is implemented on top of Sharemind [1], a secure multi-party computation. 

## System Requirement
The implementation of the system is in SecreC [2], a C++-like language that runs on top of Sharemind. The following are the required environmental setup for running the system:
* The installation of sharemind servers on 3 servers and the key authentication between the servers so they can communicate securely.
* Installation of sharemind client, that could be either on one of the 3 servers or a separate machine. Also, we need to share the key of the client on the 3 servers so they can trust the client applications.
* All the importing process of the CSV files should be performed using sharemind csv-importer.
* The installation of linux package apt-transport-https
Furthermore, to run the application, the following sharemind packages should be installed:
* sharemind-server 
* libsharemind-mod-algorithms 
* libsharemind-mod-shared3pdev or libsharemind-mod-shared3p
* libsharemind-mod-tabledb-hdf5 
* scc 
* secrec-stdlib

You can download a pre-installed sharemind virtual machine from this link for free from sharemind's [website](https://sharemind.cyber.ee/).

Or, you can install sharemind on your own environment using the following installation guid:
https://docs.sharemind.cyber.ee/2019.03/installation/application-server



## Data Format
The proposed approach assume the following:
* The data of partyA and partyB are loaded to the servers separately, each event log is in a separate file.
* To use the Outer product approach, the data should label the events in binary representation (0100), with each bit in a separate column.
* To use the parallel chunks, the data should include padding. The padding makes all the traces have the same length as the maximum length of traces of each party. 

Also, you can find preprocessing and data examples examples in python in the following directory:
'shareprom/data_and_preprocessing/'

## Running The System
The system runs as a client application on top of sharemind. You can submit your job using the following command:
'sudo sharemind-runscript job_name.sb'

## Experiment Setup
To be able to run the experiment, you need to make sure that profiling is enabled "Profiler=on", and install the package nethogs to measure the communication overhead as mentioned in the following link:
https://github.com/raboof/nethogs

To run the experiment, use the shell script file:
'shareprom/SecreC_implementation/experiment/experiment.sh'
